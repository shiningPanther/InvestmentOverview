# InvestmentOverview


## Overview
An application for macOS that lists and categorises different kinds of investments (stocks, ETFs, cryptos, etc) and calculates the profits of each one of them.

I deployed this application for two main reasons:

1. I noticed that muy broker did not keep proper track of my gains & losses so that my tax declaration was a mess and took me forever.
2. Trades on cryptocurrencies were scattered over 10s of different exchanges and it was a nightmare to keep track of them.

This application is a place to keep a detailed overview over gains & losses for different categories of investments.
